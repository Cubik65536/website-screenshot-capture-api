Website Shot is an open source cross-platform screenshot app, powered by a nodejs and nuxtjs written in JS/Vue. 
<br/>
<br/>


> NOTE: Website Shot is under active development, most of the listed features are still experimental and subject to change.

> It can't take screenshots of pages where authentication is required. Personal bank pages, E-Mail Inboxes or any other page that requires you to log in to see it, it may require using custom js to paypass that.
